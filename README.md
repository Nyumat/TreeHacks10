## Inspiration

Have you ever had to watch a video for a class, but you didn't have time to watch the whole thing? Or maybe you just wanted to skip to the important parts? We've all been there. That's why we created Athena and Minerva, two AI-powered tools that help you get the most out of your educational videos.

## What it does

Our project consists of two components.

- Athena, a full-stack Next.js application powered by Convex, Bun, and shadcn.
- Minerva, a FastAPI backend powered by Langchain, Together.ai, and OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo.

Athena allows you to ask questions to your documents. You can ask questions like "What is the main idea of this video?" or "What are the key points?" and Athena will give you a summary of the video. Athena uses natural language processing to understand your questions and provide you with the most relevant information.

Minerva allows you to search for specific topics within your documents. You can search for keywords like "calculus" or "quantum mechanics" and Minerva will show you the most relevant parts of the video.
